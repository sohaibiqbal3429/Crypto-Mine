# iOS Project Placeholder

The native iOS project is not committed to keep the repository lightweight. Run the following command to generate the iOS workspace after installing dependencies:

```bash
npx react-native init-temp ios CryptoMineMobile
```

Then copy the generated `ios/` directory into this folder and run `pod install` from `ios/`.
